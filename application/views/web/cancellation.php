	    <p><span></span>In rare cases, delays might occur due to customs clearance delays, flight delays, unavailability of ordered items and other uncontrolable circumstances like natural calamities. However, we always try our level best to ensure delivery within the number of days to delivery as mentioned above. In case the ordered item(s) do(es) not reach the customer within 30 days of our having shipped the same from India, we will offer a full refund, provided any tracking information does not show that delivery was attempted at the customer doorstep. However, in case of packages for which we do not have a tracking number, we will assume on good faith that the package delivery was not attempted and we will refund the entire amount after a month from our shipping date.

In case the package is returned to us after attempted delivery or because of a wrong shipping address provided by the customer at the time of placing order, we can reship your order, only after receiving an email and correct address from you.</span></p>
